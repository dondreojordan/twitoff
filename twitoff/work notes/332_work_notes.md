What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    How data science can be incorporated into an API like Twitter by the use of Basilica embeddings.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    Pulling real data from actual Twitter users and learning how to navigate the back-end.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    The most challenging part of the day was to understand the error with tweepy and the .env file. The error returns that basically it's bothered by something in the .env file and a non-unicode character(s). Still searching for an answer.
