What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    I noticed throughout the week that the iterative process was consistent and provided much more satisifaction when debugging. 

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    It was very interesting to take a MVP and transcribe to a more create template that was created.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    I had a challenging time getting the .env to cooperate and authenticate the account. The solution, although very small, was to check for spelling in the .env file and all dependent links.
