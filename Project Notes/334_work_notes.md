What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    Following along with the lecture to ensure a smooth deployment on the Heorku app.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    I was SUPER excited to see that template that I had created transferred without issues. 

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    I ran into a small bump trying to deploy the app to Heroku becuase of the getenv('DATABASE_URL'). I did not have a DATABASE_URL inside of the .env file so there was nothing for Heroku to locate.
